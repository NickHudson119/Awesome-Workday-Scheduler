# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
```
I was given the task to take the starter code which already had some of the html and all the css, and create a function in javascript using a time api to set the correct time and date at the top of the screen, as well as color code each timeblock "past, present, and future" according to the correct time. First I made a variable for the current time and date and then displayed the current time and date. Then I created a function using jQuery to grab each timeblock by it's id, and asign it a class of "past, present, or future" according to the currentTime variable. Then I created a function to save the text you inputed into the local storage
```
